Alongside innovation, meeting and working with new people is a huge part of the hackathon experience. HACKR aims to facilitate the team-making process in a simple, effective way for everyone involved.

HACKR is an app that helps hackers find teammates who are also interested in them and what they have to offer!

The app features a user profile highlighting the user's skillset, which is used to match them with appropriate potential teammates: think tinder but for hackathons. Potential matches can chat and eventually invite each other to a team, which shows up on the homepage alongside the user's profile and what they are looking for. Instead of scrolling through discord channels or making a last-minute scramble around the building ten minutes before hacking begins to find a team, we hope this app can help you find great people who also want to work with you, so you can build something amazing together!
